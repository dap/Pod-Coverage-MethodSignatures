NAME
    Pod::Coverage::MethodSignatures - Pod::Coverage extension for
    Method::Signatures

SYNOPSIS
      use Pod::Coverage::MethodSignatures;

      my $pcm = Pod::Coverage::MethodSignatures->new(package => 'Foo::Bar');
      print 'Coverage: ', $pcm->coverage, "\n";

      # or in a pod-coverage.t

      use Test::More;
      eval "use Test::Pod::Coverage 1.00";
      plan skip_all => "Test::Pod::Coverage 1.00 required for testing POD coverage" if $@;
      all_pod_coverage_ok({ coverage_class => 'Pod::Coverage::MethodSignatures'});

DESCRIPTION
    This module works exactly as Pod::Coverage does, but with a more chill
    approach to verifying code origin, as overridden in _get_syms(), and
    with whitelisting of func() and method(), as overridden in
    _trustme_check().

    See the documentation for Pod::Coverage for more information on usage.

    This module might also support other things such as MooseX::Declare and
    MooseX::Method::Signatures but I haven't tested that.

SEE ALSO
    Method::Signatures, Pod::Coverage, Test::Pod::Coverage

THANKS
    Pod::Coverage::Moose authors - for the borrowed Pod

    Michael Schwern - for the answered questions and verified hypotheses
